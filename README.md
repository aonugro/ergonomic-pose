Description

This dataset contains 200 labeled observations of seated posture (ideal vs non-ideal), with features extracted using MediaPipe Pose. Data were collected in July 2024 during controlled posture observation sessions.

Features:
- Neck angle
- Back angle
- Arm angle
- Leg angle
- Shoulder height difference
- Sitting duration

Label:
- `ideal`: ergonomically correct posture
- `non-ideal`: postures deviating from ISO/NIOSH standards
